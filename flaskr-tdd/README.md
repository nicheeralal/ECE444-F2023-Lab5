What are the pros and cons of TDD?

My answer:
Pros of TDD:

Improved Code Quality: TDD often results in cleaner code and a lower bug rate because the code is tested from the start.

Refactoring Confidence: With a suite of tests in place, developers can refactor or enhance code with confidence, knowing that regressions will be caught by the tests.

Better Design: Writing tests first forces developers to think about the design and interfaces of their code before implementation. This often results in more modular and maintainable code.

Documentation: The test suite acts as a form of documentation that demonstrates how the system is supposed to work. New developers can refer to the tests to understand expected behavior.

Early Bug Detection: Bugs are detected and fixed earlier in the development cycle, which can lead to cost savings compared to detecting and fixing bugs later in the process or post-release.

Enhanced Collaboration: TDD can improve collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders because it sets clear expectations of functionality.

Cons of TDD:

Learning Curve: There's a learning curve associated with mastering TDD, and not every developer is familiar with it. This can lead to initial resistance or improper implementation.

Time Consumption: Writing tests before code can seem to slow down the development process, especially initially. However, proponents argue that the time saved in debugging and maintenance offsets this initial cost.

Overhead: There's additional overhead in managing and maintaining the test suite, especially if tests become out-of-date or if there's poor test coverage.

Incomplete Test Coverage: Just because tests pass doesn't mean the software is bug-free. Tests are only as good as their coverage, and it's possible to miss certain edge cases.

False Sense of Security: Passing tests can sometimes give developers a false sense of security, leading them to believe the code is flawless when there might be scenarios not covered by the tests.

Potential for Over-Engineering: TDD can sometimes lead to over-engineering or writing more code than necessary because of an excessive focus on making tests pass.

Context Dependency: TDD might not be suitable for every project or context. For example, some exploratory or prototyping efforts might not benefit as much from TDD as a well-defined project would
